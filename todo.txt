X Implement escape sequence, either by:
	X Using a special tag "\(any)", requiring 1-character classes
	\ Using a global escape sequence when moving cursors, requiring special
	  decoding case
X Make character classes parsing greedy
	X Move cursor logics to external function, check for terminal nodes when no
	  move is possible, add a final move(null) call at the end to handle tags
	  at the end of input stream.
X Fix bug of sample text file
X Differenciate # from * while decoding list tags
X Fix bug: [b]aa[hr]bb[/b]
- Implement missing yAronet tags (see format.yn.php)
- Clean up code by removing magic arrays for branches, nodes, maybe tags?
- Make first started tag match instead of first ended
- Handle special case for <pre> tag in encoder
- Order tags by name, remove when resolved and push to scopes array
