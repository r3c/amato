X Implement escape sequence, either by:
	X Using a special tag "\(any)", requiring 1-character classes
	\ Using a global escape sequence when moving cursors, requiring special
	  decoding case
X Make character classes parsing greedy
	X Move cursor logics to external function, check for terminal nodes when no
	  move is possible, add a final move(null) call at the end to handle tags
	  at the end of input stream.
- Differenciate # from * while decoding list tags
- Clean up code by removing magic arrays for branches, nodes, maybe tags?
